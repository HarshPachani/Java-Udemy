- There are two types of an Exceptions:- 
	1. Checked Exceptions
	2. Unchecked Exceptions

-> The checked Exception is the failure that the application cannot control and so Java is gonna force you to catch Checked Exceptions.

-> A checked Exception can occur from failing to connect to a website, Trying to access a missing file, Failing to access a quary from a database.
like:- NetworkException
       FileNotFoundException
       SQLException
-> so, we can say that the code is more likely to fail if it interacts with outside resources.
-> Hence, Java is gonna force us to try to run the code and catch the exception if the code fails.
