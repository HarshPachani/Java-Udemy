- There are two types of an Exceptions:- 
	1. Checked Exceptions
	2. Unchecked Exceptions

-> Unchecked Exception happen during the runtime.

-> We can fix the Unchecked Exception.
-> Both checked and Unchecked Exceptions are the failures.
-> Difference between them:-
	-> A checked Exception is a failure that's outside the control of the application, so Java is going to force you to try to run a code and catch the exception if it fails.
	-> An Unchecked Exception is the result of badly written code, never Ever catch an Unchecked exception. instead fix your code.
	-> Unchecked Exceptions are runtime Exceptions, in other words the failure happens while the app is running and will crash an application. 

-> An Unchecked Exception Examples are
    :- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
       NullPointerException
       IllegalArgumentException
       inputMismachException
       IllegalStateException
